### Good and bad
The title is only to attract the attention and simplify. I intend to avoid the terms 'good' or 'bad' due to their subjectivity, as I didn't see a case when it adds any value to a conversation. Labeling is not helpful as well. What to use instead? I see that the terms 'in our interest' vs 'not in our interest' instead of 'good vs bad' keep the conversation focused.

When speaking of feedback in a professional setting, what helps to structure the knowledge in the domain is asking a question first: what principles of giving feedback work and which don't, or, constructive vs unconstructive.
