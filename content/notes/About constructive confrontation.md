#### Principles
1. Talk to the Right Person (who is capable of making the decision on the matter)
2. Timely, i.e. immediately after noticing the matter of discussion. 
	1. Avoid the 'attacking the past', focus on the future, on reaching the future when the issue is solved.
	2. The leading question is 'What can we do now?'
	3. How to do so it doesn't happen again.
3. Data and facts support
	1. It helps to avoid interpretations
	2. The leading question: "What is it expressed in?"
4. Focus on the issue, not on the personality or judgement. (similar to core differences in feedback types, see [[About feedback]]).


Examples of unconstructive confrontation:
- "Why haven't you deployed a new version of the product to a production environment?" (The principles)
