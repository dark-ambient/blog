#### 4 types of control
1. At the end, right before a deadline. High confidence a person can and will do the task. Also, small tasks are good candidates for that.
2. Each milestone
3. Selective
4. Periodic. Every N units of time (every day, week, month). Depends on a task
5. Random; when there are too many (conveyor, a random bottle is open for a check)
