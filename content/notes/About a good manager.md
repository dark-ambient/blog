### Main idea
> A good manager doesn't create new problems while solving already existing.

### What differs a professional from the opposite?
A pro is **pro**-actively managing the risks, and non-pro is reactive to the risks and changes most of the time.

It's one of the reasons why pros could look like doing nothing but everything works (they have done most of the things earlier, and now operationally working on managing other future risks).

Why does a pro manage the risks proactively? Well, being a pro often (if not all the time) means being experienced. 

And being experienced often means having a bunch of lessons learned. And that consequently implies being aware of particular risks given a state of a regulators, market, company, product, project, team, individuals, as well as how to avoid those negative and how to increase the chances of positive risks. (there are a few words about [[Risk management|Risk management]]).
