In tech, depending on a company, there are various seniority levels engineers have. When faced a new ladder, I see first if I can apply my favourite simple model first:

- Junior - requires a lead engineer/manager to tell 
	- **what** task and **how** to do it. And then repeats independently.

- Middle - requires a lead engineer/manager to tell 
	- **only what** to do, and is independent in finding **how**.

- Senior - requires a lead engineer/manager to tell 
	- **when to deliver** scope of work, independently finding out the answers to 'what? how?'
- Staff and above - I could recommend the [website](https://staffeng.com) and [the respective the book](https://staffeng.com/book).
