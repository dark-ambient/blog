### Step by step guidance for a negotiation preparation

##### 1. Define the problem and the goal
1. Define **the main problem** by answering the question WHAT is the pain that forces me to open the negotiation.
2. Answer the question: what will happen if the problem is not solved (the problem = the pain from the point above).
3. Define **The Goal** for which you enter the negotiation, that obviously solve **the main problem**. Here you need to answer the question: **what my opponent(s) will do** after the negotiation? That's purely the actions on the opponent side you agreed on.
##### 2. Analyse the involved parties interests
For simplicity, let's have examples of the parties involved: you, John, and Max. There are three parties in total. It doesn't mean the discussion will be happening between three of you. Moreover, a negotiation is not always a one time discussion, it could be several iterations with different parties being present face to face, or not, but still having a significant impact on the outcomes,
