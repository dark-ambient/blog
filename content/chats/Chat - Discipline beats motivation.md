**Alex**: _I have an experience with my workout routine; how my sport life totally changed when I introduced a strict schedule for that.
When I started exercising a few months ago I didn’t have a personal coach and a strict schedule. So, I squandered a huge amount of energy thinking on what day and time I wanted/should go to the gym, what exercises to do, how much volume should I do etc. I was meditating for hours before a workout trying to decide if I should go today or tomorrow, at 10 am or 2 pm. As a result, I was often already tired when I came to the gym. It turned out I went exercising 2 times a week, sometimes I could miss a session or two just because I wasn’t in the right mood or condition or I had some More Important stuff at my work.
After two months of this unsteady practice, I convinced a friend of mine to join me. We had an agreement to go to the gym together and scheduled the next session a day in advance. Things became much better. One month after that we met and hired a personal trainer. We agreed for a 3-days weekly split format. She had only a few time slots. So we decided to meet Mon, Wed and Fri at 1 pm. After two and a half months of this format I did not miss any session without a solid reason (traveling). Now I expect a workout with excitement, I have no doubts when the next one starts. I save a lot of mental energy to focus on other important things. This has become a routine and the day and time of this training is absolutely the best trigger I have ever had in my sport routine. As a result, I have gone to the gym more than 40 times during the last 4 months. That’s impressive and that is exactly what I have been dreaming about since I was 17. This simple rule: being 3 times a week at a gym at exactly 1pm. Would it work if I have no workout buddy and especially a personal trainer? No. At least I need to proceed with this practice for a couple of years until it becomes such an intrinsic part of my life that I can do it just by myself.
So, that’s how I revealed the superpower of a scheduled routine. Now I’m thinking about how I can apply this approach to other spheres of my life._

**Yauhen**: _Totally agreed. And this is how I can explain what you feel. In a society where there is too much anxiety, it’s always important to make your day's schedule around a strictly defined event. Once that decision is made, the anxiety goes away, giving you more energy. As you know, whatever happens, you go to a gym and get your dose of happiness, you feel in control of your life. And the feeling of control recharges your mental battery. And that’s why, although you lose physical energy at a gym, you are satisfied and empowered. 
On having a personal coach and why I think it’s good to have one. It’s not only giving you socially based motivation, as you, as a nice person, you want to be on time at a gym as another person (the coach) waits for you, also having a coach doesn’t take the right out of you on whether to go or not, but helps you to make a decision what, how and when to do exercises, which again saves your energy thinking about the field you don’t know._

My insight to share is that, generally, people like when they are supported during a decision making, but don’t like to have the decision made for them by somebody else.
