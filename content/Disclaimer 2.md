- I don’t claim any novelty. All the ideas are based on my own and other people’s thoughts.  Occasionally, I link the sources I learned an idea from.
- My mental model evolves, so there is no guarantee that I still believe in the ideas written in these notes by the time you are reading them.
- Life is also more complex than can be fully explained in any text: ‘**All models are wrong, but some are useful.**’
